SUBJECT: Request for Delayed Application Key - Account jryan1810

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello Betfair Support Team,

I would like to request a Delayed Application Key for development and testing purposes.

Account Details:
- Username: jryan1810
- Requested Application Name: HorseRacingML2025

I am developing a horse racing machine learning application and need API access to test my integration with Betfair data.

I have been unable to access the API developer tools visualizer (as the .com.au version is not yet available), so I would appreciate if you could create my Delayed App Key manually and email it to me.

I understand that:
- The Delayed Key is free for development purposes
- It provides delayed data (1-180 seconds)
- I will contact you separately if I need to activate the Live Key in future

Please let me know if you need any additional information from me.

Thank you for your assistance!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
